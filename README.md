This is a portfolio website. 

Starting as a freelance web developer is not easy. 

I have started from zero. I had no idea whats coding. 
Something like a year ago I have decided that I want to switch careers. From health and safety and microbiology of water, here I am. 

Plenty of stuff to learn, even after a year of learning, I consider myself a rookie and a complete noob. It will probably stay like this for couple more years. 

Anyway. enjoy. time to code.
